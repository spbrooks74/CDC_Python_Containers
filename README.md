# CDC_Python_Containers

Part1:  Use python to run MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra databases and delete them with Containers.
Part2:  Define a function to create a nested dictionary. Then, use time loops to schedule the execution of code.
Part3:  Programmatically initialize the databases and start setting up the CDC system to propagate changes from the master database, MySQL, to the other databases.
Part4:  Enhancing your CDC system to propagate the data to other databases.  Add a Redis database that is also running in a container. 
Part5:  Update a Cassandra database container.
